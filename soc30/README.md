Frontend isn't connected to the Backend yet.

This Nativescript Frontend is hugely based on the Tab Navigation Template.

To test it you need to:

1. Install a LTS version of nodejs (including npm)
2. Install nativescript via npm
3. Build this app either via nativescript sidekick locally on your phone
4. Run it
