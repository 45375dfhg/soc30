**Guide to start the backend**  
The backend consists of two components: The **MongoDB-server** and the **Node.js-server**.  
Having a MongoDB-server installed is a requirement. Its tested on version 4.0.4 with Ubuntu 18.04.  
Node.js is tested on version 8.12.0.  
**MongoDB**  
A backup of the entire database with test data is available. It is located in the folder dump.
The backup can be loaded with **mongorestore dump/** in the terminal. The terminal must be in the directory of the dump folder.
To run the database with authentication, type "mongod --auth". The server runs without --auth, too.
The test data is located in the "sandbox" collection.    
**Node.js**  
In the main directory of the node.js-sever is a **config.js** with information about the IP of the database, account information for the database and the port the node.js-server is running on. The server can be started with **node app.js** with the terminal inside the directory of app.js. The first time, and only once, you have to run **npm install** to install all used modules.
