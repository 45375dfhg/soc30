# soc30

This is the repository of the team 'NameException' for the HSMA Software Development Project 2018 / 2019. You'll find here both, the backend and frontend, of the application named 'Social 30' as well as the promised concept papers. 

Under the following google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G0spQcrZXUI0fUcPvrWQ8bhwK3jAS1JZ/view) you can download an pre-built .apk version of our app. In the intro screen you will see four pictures, reachable by swiping. The fourth picture contains an input field to set a server IP adress of your choice. Further information about the frontend are found inside the frontend folder's readme.md.

For the backend you'll find an exported mongoDB which is easily imported via the guide. Test data is included. The backend folder contains a guide to change your IP adress to your likings as well other information to set it up.
