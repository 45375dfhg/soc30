// current but not fixable in reasonable time
1. tns-template-core tries to fetch dead links inside the modules but 
	a) is required
	b) doesnt cause any harm
2. (not a bug technically) can't change dialog prompts via css

// current
1. after pressing submit in henquiryDetail the routing to henquiryComp does not route back fully -> henquiryComp ngIf does not reset
2. filterButton for time and amount can't be used with one button activated on init 
3. calendar month border fails on 15+ entries per month on older phones
4. getCategoryIconSource tries to fetch pictures with dead links
5. register validations only apply after pressing submit and not before page switch

// past
* shared button logic inside filterComponent
* user can apply to already applied buttons
* reset() on filter resets to wrong values
* locked filter class on items.comp is shared before refresh
* getItems() in item.service receives past henquiries
* getItems() in item.service receives already applied to henquiries
* formatLocation in item.service returns an undefined house number
* DatePicker and TimePicker in henquiry.detail are both broken
	a) 15min intervals not shown to the user
	b) don't lock in properly
	-> change plugin
* sortEntries in calender.comp doesn't sort date values properly (somehow 25 < 9)
* appSettings saved inside outter router-applet can't be seen inside inner router-applet and vice-versa (write a service to circumvent)
* no feedback on wrong login data
* getItems() doesnt reach server
* postItem() fails on posting the category (JSON error at pos 1)
* TimePicker returns wrong hour values (offset by 1)
* iOS can swipe to return to login screen
* iOS inner (inner) outlets still have the native return button at the top left
